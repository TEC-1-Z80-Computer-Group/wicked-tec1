The Z80 cpu emulation (z80.ts) is derived from the work of Matthew Howell:

## Emulator for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor

This module is a simple, straightforward instruction interpreter.
There is no fancy dynamic recompilation or cycle-accurate emulation.
The author believes that this should be sufficient for any emulator that
would be feasible to write in JavaScript anyway.

The code and the comments in this file assume that the reader is familiar
with the Z80 architecture. If you're not, here are some references I use:
